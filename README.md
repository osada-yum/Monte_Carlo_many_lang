# Implementation of Monte Carlo simulation for spin systems

This repository aims to implement Monte Carlo simulations for spin systems using various programming languages.


## Simulation for the relaxation of magnetization

### Languages

- [x] Fortran
- [ ] C
- [x] C++
- [x] Rust
- [x] Julia
- [x] Python3

## TODO

- [ ] Implement a random number generator for each language.
- [ ] Implement the code for equilibrium simulation
- [ ] Compare the performance across all languages.
